## Generalized Linear Models in Pharmaceutical Consultation

This project is from UCSB Statistics. Instructor: Wendy Meiring 

This project supposes a survey was conducted within San Francisco to investigate the number of individual consultations with pharmacists. 

Description of variables is in the report.

### Questions:
• Investigate how the number of consultations with a pharmacist is associated with other variables. As part of this investigation, develop a model for pharmacy managers to estimate the expected number of pharmacist consultations by a new customer within a 4 week period, if the pharmacy was provided with values of the other variables for that new customer.

• For a particular person, use fitted model to estimate the probability distribution for his/her number of pharmacy consultations within a 4 week period, i.e., estimate the probability that his/her number of pharmacist consultations equals 0,1,2, etc.

• Clearly state and discuss model(s) and assumptions, and also the limitations of analysis in the context of this study. 

### Data:
The data used is only for the course project and does not represent the true survey data. It is also not included here.

### Details:
Please see the report for a detailed analysis.
